MyShop: A Next.js eCommerce Prototype
-------------------------------------

This project is a prototype for a basic eCommerce platform built with Next.js 13 and Tailwind CSS. It utilizes a combination of server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering for optimal performance and user experience.

### Running the App

1.  **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/myshop.git  
```

1. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```
1. **Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev  
```

This will start the Next.js development server on http://localhost:3000 by default. You can then access the application in your web browser.

### Deployment

This project utilizes Next.js for building a production-ready application. Here are two common deployment options:

**1\. Static Site Hosting:**

*   Build the production application:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the .next directory. You can then deploy this folder to any static site hosting platform that supports Next.js, such as Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify.

**2\. Serverless Deployment:**

*   Configure a serverless environment on a platform like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.

*   Deploy the application code along with the serverless function configuration.

*   This approach allows for server-side functionality beyond static generation.


**Additional Considerations:**

*   Configure environment variables for sensitive information like API endpoints in production.

*   Implement proper logging and monitoring for a deployed application.


These are just a few general options, and the specific deployment process will depend on your chosen platform and configuration. Refer to the documentation of your chosen hosting provider for detailed instructions.

### My Approach

*   **Hybrid Rendering Strategy:** I primarily leveraged server-side rendering (SSR) to fetch product data on the server for optimal SEO and initial load performance. This pre-renders pages on the server, improving content visibility to search engines and providing a faster initial user experience.

*   **Suspense with loading.tsx:** To enhance user experience during initial data fetching, I incorporated loading.tsx as a suspense fallback for the UI on the server. This displays a loading indicator or placeholder content while the server retrieves and processes data, preventing a blank screen for the user.

*   **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind's utility-first approach allowed for rapid UI development and styling of the application. This approach provides a large set of pre-defined classes that can be easily combined to achieve desired design elements.

*   **Data Validation:** Zod was integrated to ensure type-safe validation of data submitted through the product addition form. This helps prevent potential errors and maintains data integrity.

*   **API Mocking:** MSW was utilized during development to mock API responses. This allowed for testing and development without relying on an external API, streamlining the development process.

*   **End-to-End Testing with Playwright:** Playwright was incorporated to automate end-to-end (E2E) testing of the application. This allows for simulating user interactions across different browser environments and ensuring the functionality of various pages. Playwright helps to catch regressions and maintain code quality throughout the development process.


**Robust API Interaction with Error Handling:**

The application utilizes a custom Requester class to manage interactions with the API and handle potential errors gracefully. This class:

*   Encapsulates logic for fetching and posting data to the API endpoint.

*   Standardizes request formatting and error handling across the application.

*   Provides methods for both GET and POST requests.

*   Implements error handling using a try...catch block to catch exceptions during the request process.

*   Throws informative errors with details about failed requests.

*   Currently logs errors to the console, but can be integrated with a third-party error logging tool like Sentry for a more robust solution.


By incorporating this Requester class, the application gains a reliable and maintainable way to interact with the API while ensuring proper error handling for a robust user experience.

**Note:** Error handling for API requests is not implemented comprehensively in this prototype, but the foundation is laid for a more robust solution in production.

This project provides a starting point for building a full-fledged eCommerce platform. Feel free to customize and extend it to fit your specific needs.
